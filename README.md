# DeltaAppDev-Task1-FunFactor
### This project is made by Vignesh S, EEE-B, 1st year, NITT. This projected is submitted to DELTA, club of NITT as a process of Delta Summer 
Mentorship program. 
### A number must be entered in the EditText view and then 'READY' button must be clicked. If the button is clicked without entering any number, it throws a toast message to enter a number.
### Clicking the 'READY' button shows the options containing only one factor of the entered number. Clicking the radio button of desired choice will directly let u know whether the clicked option is right or not.
### If the timer ends, and the user has not chosen anything, the user will be asked to finish the current round and the correct answer will be displyed.
### After a correct selection of the radio button(i.e is the right answer), a 'NEXT' button will appear to take the user to the next round where he will continue from beginning of entering a number and so on.
### This app uses  streak count as a scoring metric. If the user enters a wrong answer, the current streak of the player comes to and end and the user is asked to finish and start a new game.
The game activity screen has both the longest streak achieved by the user and the current streak. The starting screen has the longest streak achieved by the player.
### Thank you.
